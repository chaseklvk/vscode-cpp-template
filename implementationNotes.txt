bool delete(TreeNode*, value);

1) Is the rootNode null?
  not found, return false

2) Is the value equal root value?
  2.1) Is the root left and right null?
    delete root
    return true
  2.2) Is the root right not null?
    save the left (leftNode)
    save the right (rightNode)
    delete root
    root = rightNode
    addNode(root, leftNode)
    return false
  2.3) Is the root left not null?
    save the left (leftNode)
    delete root
    root = leftNode
    return false
3) Is the value less than the root value?
  delete(TreeNode->left, value)
  if return is true
    TreeNode->left = nullptr
  return false

4) Is the value greater than the root value?
  delete(TreeNode->right, value)
  if return is true
    TreeNode->right = nullptr
  return false
